## Problem Statement

This dashboard is used on a dataset from Kaggle which helps amazon2_raw understand their customers better. It helps amazon2_raw know if their customers are satisfied with their services from 2011 to 2014, they get to know their customers' needs and which product has the highest profit and sales, & thus they can improve their services by identifying customer behavior and sales from 2011 to 2014. It also lets them know the sum of average selling price & total profit from 2011 to 2014 & total COGS, thus by using this dashboard they have identified TOTAL SALES and total profit, most products achieved the maximum profit over years, days, and months. they can further work on factors responsible for overview sales over the years concerning which product achieved the maximum profit.

Since, products like fasteners, envelopes, and labels achieved the lowest sales and lowest profit. thus in all, they must work on marketing or survey what customers frequently buy to maintain the curve of customers 'needs. 

Also, sales increased accordingly from 2011 to 2014 thus they're always improving based on customers' needs across the years.
